### Comments ###
Comments in python should have a single space after the # symbol. Currently the rule is to avoid block comments.

Import order:
	- Imports from python standard libraries are placed first
	- Imports from third party libraries are placed second
	- Imports from within the application are placed last
Within each of these groupings, they should be ordered alphabetically by package name, with each module sorted alphabetically.
